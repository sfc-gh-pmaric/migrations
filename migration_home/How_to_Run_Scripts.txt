How to set up your environment and run the scripts

Account Replication will handle replication of users, roles, warehouses, resource monitors and privileges for replicated databases.
Database Replication will handle replication of databases, schemas and objects within it

To replicate Stages, Pipes, Streams, Tasks and/or Shares, Please follow the steps below:

Step 0: (as needed) Edit code in lines 291, 292 of 'run_nonreplicated_objects.py' to include only the NRO object types desired for DDL and grants

-- ALL OBJECT TYPES SHOW HERE, SO MANUALLY REMOVE / CHANGE AS NEEDED
    object_dict = {'STAGE':[],'STREAM':[],'TASK':[],'SHARE':[],'PIPE':[]}
    grants_dict = {'STAGE':[],'STREAM':[],'TASK':[],'SHARE':[],'PIPE':[]}

Step 1: Edit dbfile to list all the database names from which to replicate stages, pipes, streams and tasks
-- Contents of sample dbfile: 
        FIRST_DB
        SECOND_DB
        THIRD_DB

Step 2: Edit the env_xxx.sh (Unix) or env_xxx.cmd (Windows) with source and target account credentials, and role name that has SYSADMIN and Manage Grants privileges at the account level.
You could use ACCOUNTADMIN as the role if you have ACCOUNTADMIN privilege.

Step 3: Run generate_nonreplicated_objects_ddl.sh to generate ddl files from source account

Step 4: Promote the target (also known as replica or secondary) databases to primary. Replica databases are read-only.

Step 5: Run create_nonreplicated_objects.sh to create objects in target account
